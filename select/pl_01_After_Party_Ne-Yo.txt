Said yo man got you stressed,
well let's get away
Get out 4 the night,
wanna impress you, baby
I won't stop till we hit
the final destination
Oh oh, oh oh
Said your eyes said it all,
ain't gotta say a word
Too deep in ya spine,
touching all ya nerves
Girl, the way yo pussy talk,
you don't need no work
Oh oh, oh oh
This stroke got you clutching
yo stomach
Feeling it in the mourning,
ain't this what you wanted?
Ya homegirl tryna fuck
But it's you that I want
Tryna give you
this thug passion, baby
The way you arch yo back
when you toot it up like that
Tryna give you
this thug passion, baby
Girl, impress me show you,
ain't wasting time
Love the way that
you griping me when we grind
You ain't gotta tell me,
I already know it's mine
Oh oh, oh oh
Got yo legs spread around
like a ceiling fan
Girl, yo body speak a language
I understand
Going deeper and deeper
till you say when
Oh oh, oh oh
This stroke got you clutching
yo stomach
Feeling it in the mourning,
ain't this what you wanted?
Ya homegirl tryna fuck
But it's you that I want
Tryna give you
this thug passion, baby
The way you arch yo back
when you toot it up like that
Tryna give you
this thug passion, baby
Slow and easy is the way
I wanna love you tonight
(Slow and easy, oh)
Slow and easy is the way
I wanna love you tonight
(Said I wanna take my time)
Slow and easy is the way
I wanna love you tonight
(Slow and easy, baby)
Wanna take it slow and easy
Slow and easy is the way
I wanna love you tonight
Slow and easy is the way
I wanna love you tonight
Slow and easy is the way
I wanna love you tonight
Wanna take it slow and easy...
